# Even-Odd-data-set-analyzer
A simple Python script that takes user input of odd and even numbers as comma-separated values. It extracts the numbers, filters out non-numeric values, and displays the maximum, minimum, and count of both odd and even numbers. Ideal for beginners learning basic string processing, list comprehensions, and user input handling in Python.
